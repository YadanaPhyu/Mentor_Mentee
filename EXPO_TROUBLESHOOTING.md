# ðŸ”§ Expo Network Error Solutions

## Problem: `java.io.IOException: failed to download remote update`

This error occurs when Expo can't download updates due to network issues. Here are multiple solutions:

### âœ… **Solution 1: Offline Mode (Currently Running)**
```bash
npx expo start --offline
```
- Bypasses network download requirements
- Works perfectly for development and testing
- All features including email functionality work normally

### âœ… **Solution 2: Clear Expo Cache**
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```
- Clears cached data that might be corrupted
- Forces fresh download of dependencies
- Useful when offline mode isn't preferred

### âœ… **Solution 3: Reset Metro Cache**
```bash
npx expo start --reset-cache
```
- Clears Metro bundler cache
- Resolves bundling-related issues
- Good for persistent problems

### âœ… **Solution 4: Network Troubleshooting**
```bash
# Check internet connection
ping google.com

# Try different DNS servers
# Windows: Use 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1

# Temporarily disable VPN/Proxy if using
```

### âœ… **Solution 5: Update Expo CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli@latest
npx expo install --fix
```

### âœ… **Solution 6: Tunnel Mode (For Network Issues)**
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```
- Uses ngrok tunnel for connectivity
- Bypasses local network restrictions
- Slower but more reliable connection

### âœ… **Solution 7: Local Network Mode**
```bash
npx expo start --lan
```
- Uses local network instead of localhost
- Good for connecting multiple devices
- Avoids some connectivity issues
